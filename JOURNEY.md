1- Check Celery
2- Choose boilerplate

# Boilerplate selection
While I understand a web framework wasn't needed on this techtest, a quick boilerplate could add a lot of value and ease of use for a small time spent. As you say it is a first step to lead into a system deployable in production, I figured that in this case the time spent was worth it.
I went and selected a very lightweight boilerplate: https://github.com/AGTGreg/DjangoBoilerplate - Mostly to skip the postgres & docker implementation, a staple on any project I start.
