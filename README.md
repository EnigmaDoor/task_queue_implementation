Quick task queue implementation

## Journey
Check JOURNEY.md for explanation on the architecture.

## Initial setup
### 1. Setup the environment variables
The environment variables are in `dev.env` that is used by docker-compose.yml and `prod.env` that is used by `docker-compose.prod.yml`.
Make sure to edit them and change at least the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`

### 2. Build the containers
First you need to install Docker and Docker compose in your machine:
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
Then build the docker containers. Open your terminal and write:
```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```
This will run all the build scripts that create the necessary environment for the app to run. Nothing will be installed in your computer. Instead Docker will create containers that run Linux and install all the necessary libraries and dependencies and run the app in there.

### localhost:8000
Is available for testing.
